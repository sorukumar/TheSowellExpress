"The most fundamental fact about the ideas of the political left is that they do not work. Therefore we should not be surprised to find the left concentrated in institutions where ideas do not have to work in order to survive."

- One-size-fits-all approaches fail many
- Competition improves quality

### Myth 3: Only Experts Can Judge Education
- Parents often know their children's needs best
- Market feedback provides valuable information
- Local knowledge matters

## Real-World Evidence

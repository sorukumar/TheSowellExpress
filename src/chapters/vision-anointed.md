# The Vision of the Anointed

<div class="sowell-quote">
"The vision of the anointed is one in which ills of society can be solved by the wisdom and will of its elites, and progress is measured by how much power is shifted to those elites."
<div class="quote-source">
— The Vision of the Anointed (1995)

</div>

## Core Concept

The Vision of the Anointed describes how intellectual elites:
- See themselves as morally and intellectually superior
- Believe they can solve society's problems through control
- Dismiss opposing views as stemming from ignorance or bad motives
- Judge policies by intentions rather than results

## The Pattern

### Stage 1: "The Crisis"
- Declare a crisis exists
- Use dramatic language
- Cherry-pick statistics
- Ignore contrary evidence

### Stage 2: "The Solution"
- Propose government intervention
- Claim moral high ground
- Dismiss cost concerns
- Promise dramatic results

### Stage 3: "The Results"
- Ignore actual outcomes
- Blame insufficient funding
- Attack critics' motives
- Move goalposts

### Stage 4: "The Response"
- Deny failure
- Claim more time needed
- Propose bigger programs
- Repeat cycle

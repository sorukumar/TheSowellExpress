# Supply and Demand

<div class="sowell-quote">
  "The first lesson of economics is scarcity: there is never enough of anything to fully satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics."

## Core Concept

Supply and demand is not just a theory—it's a description of how millions of people coordinate their actions without anyone directing them.

### Key Points
1. **When prices rise:**
   - Suppliers produce more.
   - Consumers buy less.
2. **When prices fall:**
   - Suppliers produce less.
   - Consumers buy more.

## Real-World Applications

### Housing Markets
- **High rents signal:**
  - Housing shortage.
  - Need for new construction.
  - Areas of high demand.
- For a deeper dive, see [Real-World Applications: Housing Markets](../real-world/housing.md).

### Labor Markets
- **High wages attract:**
  - More workers.
  - Skills development.
  - Industry growth.

## Think It Through

Consider minimum wage laws:
- **What happens to the supply of workers?**
  - Higher wages may increase the supply of workers willing to work.
- **What happens to the demand for workers?**
  - Employers may hire fewer workers due to higher costs.
- **Who benefits? Who loses?**
  - Benefits: Workers who keep their jobs at higher wages.
  - Loses: Workers who may lose jobs or find fewer opportunities.

## Further Exploration

- **Price Controls:** Investigate how government-imposed price ceilings and floors affect supply and demand dynamics.
- **Elasticity:** Understand how the elasticity of demand and supply influences market responses to price changes.
